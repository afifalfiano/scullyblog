In this blog or article, I'm going to tell a story about my collaborative experience in a working environment.
First, I use my blog because I have this personal blog and I usually wrote some tutorials or my opinion on this website. Although this website is a free service, I'm still enjoyed this. Anyway, I use netlify for hosting websites and only use the framework Angular + Scully to create this website. To reduce time, Let me share my experience.

In the company that I worked for, I usually collaborate with other people. Because when we were working we were always discussing or collaborative with each other. As a developer especially on frontend developer I usually collaborate with UI UX or user interface user experience that is the main role of UI UX is to research and design websites or apps. With UI UX I usually implement the design to the website. Besides that, I also have collaborated with other developers especially on backend and database development. So, in this case, I consume API which means how we can communicate from backend and frontend. 

When we get obstacles, we have an option for a solution. First, we search on google to get a solution for the problem either on code or algorithm. Second, we ask other developers, if any developer has the same problem we can ask and get a quick solution but if we are still stuck in this problem we can share it with other developers and try to solve together the problem. The part of the search solution that I liked is when we discuss each other.

In every team development, we have one project owner. The main role of the project owner is the management team and project, for example when we started the project, how to handle requests from the client, how to prevent requests when the team has a lot of tasks, and many other things.

I hope this blog is useful for all of my friends and see you in the next blog.

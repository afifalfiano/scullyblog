Hello, this is my first blog in English. So, if there is something wrong in my blog, I would say sorry.

In this section, I will tell you about how does it feel when you as a frontend developer. But, before that? Do you know what is Frontend Developer?

Thankfully for Google, which means you can open the browser and then search what is frontend developer and you will see many articles about that. Simply, Frontend Developer is a role job in developing products digitally. For example, When we want to create some website application, We need a user interface, database, technology that we want to use, and many things. In development, Frontend has a job to implement design from User Interface Designer(UI). So, we wait for the design and we prepare for implementation design. What did we prepare? We initialize project web apps, we create components web, we create routing, we create optimization on the client browser, etc.

As a frontend developer, you will face many algorithm logic and problem. As a designer maybe they can create an awesome design. But after the design take over to the frontend developer. We will think about how can I create this model or design. At the moment you will confuse and search many articles on how to implement that design,

We collaborate with the designer and backend developer(create application programming interface and database). After we implement the design from the designer, the next step is how to make the dynamic website, which means we need data and some action on a website. Yap, we need to collaborate with the backend developer. Application Programming Interface (API) is like a bridge that connecting from frontend and backend to communicate data.

The main role of a frontend developers is how to implement design from UI designers and how to consume or communicate data (API) with backend. Thank you
